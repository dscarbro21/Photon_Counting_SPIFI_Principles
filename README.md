## About

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook [photon_counting_SPIFI_principles.ipynb](photon_counting_SPIFI_principles.ipynb) which simulates photon counting SPIFI to demonstrate its use case and benefit.
The example code for the simulation also demonstrates the general process for acquiring and processing photomultiplier tube signals to produce photon counting SPIFI images.

The Jupyter notebook file is viewable here on GitHub, and can be downloaded if you want to run it yourself and adjust the code. A PDF version and an HTML version are also available for download.
